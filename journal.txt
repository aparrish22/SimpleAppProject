-Importing Sample Data into DB using XAMPP-

Instead, I literally extracted test_db-master into E:\xampp\mysql\bin and ran this line in XAMPP shell script...

mysql -u root -p test < employees.sql





-How am I going to use PHP and AJAX to get this stuff?-


JavaScript: Call to a HTTP Request to 

a PHP file that will retrieve the data.


Loop this php line
	$array = mysql_fetch_row($result);  
, creating an array of row arrays. Then json_encode the final array.

NEXT

Use ajax to populate jQuery dataTable!
